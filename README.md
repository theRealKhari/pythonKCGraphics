Writing a python 2D and 3D renderer for learning purposes...

Trying to write one without any major libraries. (will purposely be redundant at some times to help me grasp concepts)

main.py is the main file that when run will output whatever I want to the PPM file. 

(main.py will also hold some major functions like line drawing algorithms)

Planning to store data from 2D/3D objects in separate text files. and read those files in main.py

the graphicsMath file is a library that will hold any math related functions (matrix multiplication, vector dot products... etc) As said before these
will all be written in python and not using any libraies like Numpy. (maybe will write some C to bind to these functions as a future exercise?)
