Writing a python 2D and 3D renderer for learning purposes...

Trying to write one without any major libraries. (will purposely be redundant at some times to help me grasp concepts)

main.py is the main file that when run will output whatever I want to the PPM file. 

the graphicsMath file is a library that will hold any math related functions (matrix multiplication, vector dot products... etc) As said before these
will all be written in python and not using any libraies like Numpy. (maybe will write some C to bind to these functions as a future exercise?)
